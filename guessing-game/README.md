### Immutable 

rust var immutable by default 

```rust
let guess = String::new();
```

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

`&mut` mean get reference modiy but without taking the ownership

```rust
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
```

This is just read the reference.
```rust
guess.cmp(&secretNumber);
```

### Add dependency

in `Cargo.toml`
```rust 
[dependencies]
rand = "0.5.5"
```

then `cargo build`

### Naming 
You can define the same name in the same scope. 

What's crazzy is that! ðŸ¤ª
It's called shadowing.

Shadowing meaning convert one type to another type but we keep the name

### match 
  just like if,else, switch case 


### Add .zshrc

```
