# Testing 
Rust have bring the value of type system such as borrow checker, make sure we are passing the right type and not mismanaging our memory 

But I cant check the business logic, the intent of our code  

```Bash
cargo new adder --lib
cargo  test

```

```Rust
    #[test]
    fn failing_test() {
      panic!("Make this test fail");
    }

  assert_eq
  asser_ne

  assert!(
    result.contains("Carol"),
    "Greeting did not contain name, value was {}", result
  )

```
