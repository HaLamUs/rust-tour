## Object oriented
3 characteristics: 
- objects 
- encapsulation
- inheritance 

1. Objects 
Objects are made out of data and methos that operate on that data but not struct or enum 

2. Encapsulation 
which means that implementation details of an object are hidden from the code USING that object 

Instead of changing the internals directly code OUTSIDE of the object is limited to interacting with the object through its public api 

## Pub keyword 
In rust everything is private by default
