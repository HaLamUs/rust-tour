## Crate 
A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Whenever rustc some_file.rs is called, some_file.rs is treated as the crate file

Upload your own code to crates.io 

## Profile 

```bash
// dev 
cargo build
```

```bash
// release
cargo build --release
```

### Cargo.toml

```bash
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```

The trade-off 

For dev, We will have a fast compile time a slower run time 

Release mode, slower compile time for a faster runtime
