## Drop trait 
The drop trait could be implemented on any type and it allows you to customize what happens when a value goes out of scope.

Example: 
- Box SP, we want deallocated memory on heap when out of scope 
- SP uses `lock` we want to release it when it out of scope 

## Drop method 

```Rust
c.drop(); // error 
drop(c); // supported by Rust 
```

## Summary
the drop trait combined with Rust ownership meaning we dont need to take the cleaning up memory. Rust will do that
