## Cargo workspace
Simple CLI program that had a binary crate and a library crate 
### Problem 
Project growing we have mul lib crates 

Cargo workspace helps you organize your project workspace.

Workspaces help you manage mul related packages that are developed in tandem.

Packages in a workspace share common dependency, share one output directory 

## Scenario
One binary that depends on two libs 

## Structure 
- `add-one` is a library that has `fun add_one`

- `adder` is a binary that uses `fun add_one`


1. Add workspace by define Cargo.toml 

2. Create binary adder 
  ``` bash
  cargo new adder
  cargo build 
  ```

3. Create lib add-one
  ```bash
  cargo new add-one --lib
  ```

4. Add dependency `adder` - Cargo.toml

```
[dependencies]
add-one = { path = "../add-one" }
```

build `adder` and run 

```bash
cargo build

cargo run -p adder // p: package

```
