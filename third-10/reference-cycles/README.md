## Memory leak 
Rust guarantee that you CANT have data races but memory leaks.

You can create a memory that is never cleaned up by rc smart pointer, reference counting sp, refcell sp.

Using these sp create references where item reference each other each other in a cycle which will create a memory leak 

## Example 

`Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>>`

We use Rc because we want List have multiple owner.
We use RefCell because we want to be able to mutate the list 

## Reference cycles

First 
<img src="./imgs/1.png">

After
<img src="./imgs/2.png">

```Rust
  // Uncomment thex next line to see that we have a cycle
  // it will overflow the stack

  println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
```

Because we println PRINTLN, a.tail = b, b.tail = a the infinite loop 

### Clean up 
The stack memory clean up but not the heap memory.
Because the heap vars still pointing each other. They got orphaned and wont cleaned up

Creating Reference cycles is logical bug in your code 


```Rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
  Nil,
}

impl List {
  fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
    match self {
      Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
      Nil => None,
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));

  println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
  println!("a next item {:?}", a.tail());

  let b = Rc::new(Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));

  println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); // 2
  println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b)); // 1
  println!("b next item {:?}", b.tail()); // a 

  if let Some(link) = a.tail() { // Link is nill
    *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b)
  }

  println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
  println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

  // Uncomment thex next line to see that we have a cycle
  // it will overflow the stack

  println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());

}

```


## Fix 

```Rust
parent:  RefCell<Rc<Node>>, // create reference cycle 
parent:  RefCell<Weak<Node>>, // because parent drop, children drop either - 1 way 

```

```Rust
*leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
```

`downgrade` to change reference counting sp to weak sp

`upgrade` convert weak sp to rc sp 
Because weak sp has no idea, the value droped or not 

## Weak smart pointer 
Weak sp is a version of the reference counting sp that holds a non-owning reference

## Rc sp

RC sp stores 2 counts
  - strong_count: number of ref which have ownership of the data 
  - weak_count: number of ref which doesn't have ownership of the data
