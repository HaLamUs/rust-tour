## Deref trait 
Deref trait allows you to customize the behavior dereference operator `*`


```Rust
  let y = &x; // 1
  let y = Box::new(x); // 2

```

`1` y is reference to x, is a memory address, or a poitner points to the location where `5` is stored

ðŸ”´ `2` y is pointing to a copy of `5` because primitives type (integer) get passed to a function the value is copied instead of ownership being transfer 


### Explain 

Box is SP that implement deref trait which allows dereference operator to work the same as if it were a reference. ðŸ˜²
