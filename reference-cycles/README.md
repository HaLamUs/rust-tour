## Memory leak 
Rust guarantee that you CANT have data races but memory leaks.

You can create a memory that is never cleaned up by rc smart pointer, reference counting sp, refcell sp.

Using these sp create references where item reference each other each other in a cycle which will create a memory leak 

## Example 

`Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>>`

We use Rc because we want List have multiple owner.
We use RefCell because we want to be able to mutate the list 

## Reference cycles

First

After
<img src="./imgs/2.png">

```Rust
  // Uncomment thex next line to see that we have a cycle
  // it will overflow the stack

  println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
```

Because we println PRINTLN, a.tail = b, b.tail = a the infinite loop 

### Clean up 
The stack memory clean up but not the heap memory.
Because the heap vars still pointing each other. They got orphaned and wont cleaned up

Creating Reference cycles is logical bug in your code
