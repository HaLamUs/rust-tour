## Reference counting 
RC allows us to share ownership of some data 

### Problem 
Most of the cases, ownership is clear, we know extractly which variable owns a specific value. But we have cases where a single value has multiple owners for example 

Graph with multiple edges that point to the same node conceptly that node is owned by all the edges 

## RC smart pointer 
RC SP which will keep track the number of references to a value and when there are no more references the value will get cleaned up 

An analogy: When you watching TV with some friends, you cant turn it off without having ppl watching it

Usecase when we want to allocate a value on the heap and have multip;le parts of our program read that value 
ðŸ”´ This only working in single thread programs

```Rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  Nil
}


fn main() {
  let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box:new(Nil))));
  let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
  let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a)); // error cause b owns a now // a have been moved into b 
}

```

### Lifetime reference 
We can use a lifetime to solve above problem 

<'a> just a syntax
```
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y : &'a str) -> &'a str {
```

But we have this 
```
// let a = Cons(5, &Nil); // cant ref nil 
```

### Solution 

Use RC 

```Rust
use std::rc::Rc;

enum List {
  Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
  Nil
}

fn main() {
  let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc:new(Nil)))));
  let b = Cons(3, a.clone()); // same as below 
  let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}

```

```Rc::clone``` this code doesnt make deep copies of the data 

This clone only increments the ref count 


```Rust

let b = Cons(3, &a); // miss match type Rc vs &Rc
let b = Cons(3, a); // will move the owner ship 
let b = Cons(3, a.clone()); 

```
