## Closure 
Closure is anonymous function.

No name, store as variable and pass around, capture variable in their scope  

### Problem

```Rust
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
  if intensity < 25 {
    println!(
      "Today, do {} pushups!",
      simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity) // 1
    );
    println!(
      "Next, do {} situps!",
      simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity) // 2
    );
  } else {
    if random_number == 3 {
      println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!")
    } else {
      println!(
        "Today, run for {} minutes!",
        simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
      );
    }
  }
```

Too much duplicate code 

Normal ppl fix (1, 2) will create a var too keep track the closure's return value 

## Fix 
Memorialization pattern 
By using struct that hold closure and the result of closure 

`Fn(u32) -> u32` this called trait.

```Rust
struct Cacher<T> where T: Fn(u32) -> u32, {
  calculation: T, 
  value: Option<u32>,
}

impl<T> Cacher<T> where T: Fn(u32) -> u32, {
  fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
    Cacher {
      calculating,
      value: None,
    }
  }

  fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
    match self.value {
      Some(v) => v,
      None => {
        let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
        self.value = Some(v);
        v
      }
    }
  }
}

fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
  let mut cached_result = Cacher::new (|num| {
    println!("calculating slowly ...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
  });

  if intensity < 25 {
    println!(
      "Today, do {} pushups!",
      cached_result.value(intensity)
    );
    println!(
      "Next, do {} situps!",
      cached_result.value(intensity)
    );
  } else {
    if random_number == 3 {
      println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!")
    } else {
      println!(
        "Today, run for {} minutes!",
        cached_result.value(intensity)
      );
    }
  }
}

```


## Example closure

```Rust
let example_closure = |x| x;

let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
let n = example_closure(5); // <-- error's here: missmatched type

```

Because, first type (string) passed intro the closure will be concrete type of input parameter's closure 

## Scope of closure 

```Rust
fn main() {
  let x = 4;
  let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;

  fn equal_to_x(z) -> bool{
    z == x // can not access x
  }

  let y = 4;
  assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

Closure capture value in 3 ways
1. Taking ownership
2. Borrowing mutably
3. Borrowing immutably 

According to 3 traits 

`FnOnce, FnMut, Fn`

1. FnOnce takes ownership of var inside closure. Closure cant take ownership of SAME var more than once  
2. FnMut borrows value 
3. Fn borrow value immutably 

Why we want take the ownership of var?

Usecase pass closure from one thread to another, same as var passing ownership

Take ownership by `move` keyword

```Rust
let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
println!("Cant use x here {:?}", x); // error 

```
