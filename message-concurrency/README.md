## Message passing 
Using messages to pass data b/w threads. This ensures safe concurrency  

Go' slogan: Do not communicate by sharing memory instead share memory by communicating 

## Channel 
Using channel for passing messages 

Include 2 parts: transmitter and receiver 

Think about river analogy, the transmitter is the upstream location where you place the rubber duck and the receiver is the downstream location where the rubber duck will END up.

One of your code is calling the function transmitter and another part of your code is listening to the receiver
